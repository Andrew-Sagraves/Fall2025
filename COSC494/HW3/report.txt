Part 1:

Dishonest casino implemented in casino_simulator.cpp

to run, compile and then run ./casino. will output 300 dice rolls

###################

Part 2:

Sequences were downloaded

###################

Part 3:

Forward Algorithm

compile and run like this:

~/dev/COSC494/HW3 (main)> ./forward < casino.benchmark1.txt
Log probability of sequence = -534.942829


~/dev/COSC494/HW3 (main)> ./forward < casino.benchmark2.txt
Log probability of sequence = -535.085341

###################

Part 4:

Viterbi Algorithm implemented in viterbi.txt

usage: ./viterbi < input.txt > output.txt

results are in viterbi.1.txt and viterbi.2.txt

##################

Part 5: genomes were retrieved

##################

Part 6: GLIMMER gene prediction

this was a bore. to do this, i had to take the two input genomes, run them through:

long-orfs,
extract,
build-icm,
glimmer3

and finally we got an output file. those are attached as Ames_anscestor_out.detail and Ames_lab_out.detail 

here are the basic outputs

1. 
Sequence file = Ames_lab.fasta
Number of sequences = 1
ICM model file = Ames_lab_out.icm
Excluded regions file = none
List of orfs file = none
Input is NOT separate orfs
Independent (non-coding) scores are used
Circular genome = true
Truncated orfs = false
Minimum gene length = 100 bp
Maximum overlap bases = 30
Threshold score = 30
Use first start codon = false
Start codons = atg,gtg,ttg
Start probs = 0.600,0.300,0.100
Stop codons = taa,tag,tga
GC percentage = 35.4%
Ignore score on orfs longer than 503

2.
Sequence file = Ames_ancestor.fasta
Number of sequences = 1
ICM model file = Ames_ancestor_out.icm
Excluded regions file = none
List of orfs file = none
Input is NOT separate orfs
Independent (non-coding) scores are used
Circular genome = true
Truncated orfs = false
Minimum gene length = 100 bp
Maximum overlap bases = 30
Threshold score = 30
Use first start codon = false
Start codons = atg,gtg,ttg
Start probs = 0.600,0.300,0.100
Stop codons = taa,tag,tga
GC percentage = 35.4%
Ignore score on orfs longer than 503
